    These are the code libraries we have available for the drone recovery API
    currently. These language libraries are autogenerated using the OpenAPI on a
    regular basis. Pick the language that suits the resources you have available
    to your development team.
  footer: >-
    When we update the OpenAPI for the project we regenerate these libraries. If
    there is a specific lanaguage, or platform you'd like to see made available,
    please submit an issue on the Github repository, and we will see what we can
    do.
