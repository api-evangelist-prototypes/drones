    These are the plans we currently offer associated with API usage. Things are
    broken down into three tiers, who all have access to resources, but at a
    different rate, possessing different limits.

    This is just an example of what pricing might look like for this drone API.
    As I dial in the resources, I will evolve the plans, and the elements,
    metrics, timeframes, geograph opportunities, as well as the limitations as I
    have time.
