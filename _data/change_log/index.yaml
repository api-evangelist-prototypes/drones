  header: >-
    This is a detailed log of the changes that have been made to the Drone over
    time. We try to keep a log of all changes here to keep a history of
    everything that has happened. This also acts as the story of the platform,
    helping share the thought that goes into the platform, so that other
    providers can help follow.
  footer: >-
    When something on the road map has been satisfied, or an issue has been
    resolved we try to move it here. Since this is just a prototype API project,
    once something on the road map gets reflected on the main page for the site,
    or shared as a story on the blog, we'll mark it done, considering it part of
    the operations.
