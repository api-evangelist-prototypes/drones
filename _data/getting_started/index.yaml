    The documentation for this API is publicly available, but you have to signup
    for a developer account before you will get access to the API. Here are the
    steps to take to get up and running using the API, and the resources
    available here.

    We encourage you to get involved with the project beyond just consuming
    data. You can connect with the API platform team, as well as the rest of the
    community using the support page--thank you for you help!
