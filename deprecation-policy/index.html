<p><strong>Deprecation Policy</strong><br />
The REST API deprecation policy should be consumed in additional to any other relevant deprecation policies. When there is a conflict of policy, the most restrictive policy should be followed.</p>

<p><strong>Announcements</strong><br />
All effort should be taken to notify consumers, through all relevant communication channels of new deprecations.

<p><strong>Time Frames</strong><br />
Publicly accessibly REST APIs must be given reasonable notice of deprecations. Any deprecated REST API in the cloud environment MUST be available in it's original form for at least 6 months, UNLESS there are critical security vulnerabilities or these APIs are provided by plugin extensions as noted above.

<p><strong>Detectability</strong><br />
Requests which are made to deprecated APIs SHOULD return a header on the response to notify the consumer that the endpoint is deprecated
